	<h1>Work</h1>

	<p>
	My entire post-college decade has been spent doing product management for Microsoft Office apps on iOS and macOS (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote). I also contributed to the Surface Neo and Duo software and incubate an AR+VR productivity experience. Some of this work got covered in the news:
		<ul>
			<li>At the WWDC 2019 keynote, Craig Federighi demoed my crew's work.</li>
			<li>Aligned Microsoft's mobile apps to a single design language, working across a dozen orgs.</li>
			<li>My tweet announcing Dark Mode support in Office went viral.
		</ul>
