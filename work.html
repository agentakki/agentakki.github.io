	<h3>Why Product Management?</h3>
	<p>
	I knew I wanted to be in tech since I was 10. Luckily, I grew up in a household that encouraged problem-solving — from fixing appliances to making my own toys. My dad worked in sales and my mum was into arts and applied sciences, so I got a childhood at the intersection of Business, Experience and Technology (BXT). This is my first passion: solving problems.
	<p>
	At UCLA, I joined ACM, the computer science club. I became the president in my junior year and reinvigorated the club, taking it from 20 to 200 members. Leading 12 club officers to host over a hundred events in a year gave the computing majors a sense of community. This became my second passion: leading teams to do great things.</p>
	<p>
	These two passions got me an internship at Microsoft. I worked in the rebel group making delightful apps for Apple and grew into an advocate for craftsmanship and UX. This developed into my third passion, nurtured by my manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hashaw">Han-yi</a>. What had been a dormant appreciation for the arts (thanks mum), became a differentiating tenet in my work. </p>

	<p>I chose to do product management because it fulfil my three passions: problem-solving, design and leading teams.

	<h3>Microsoft</h3>
	<p>
	My entire post-college decade has been spent doing product management for Microsoft Office apps on iOS and macOS (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote). I also contributed to the Surface Neo and Duo software and incubate an AR+VR productivity experience. Some of this work got some attention:
		<ul>
			<li>At the WWDC 2019 keynote, Craig Federighi <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/101/?time=3981">demoed</a> my crew's work.</li>
			<li><a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/microsoft365mobile-3b5b7782152c">Aligned</a> Microsoft's mobile apps to a single design language and redesigned them for microtasking, working across a dozen orgs.</li>
			<li>My tweet (and sun-moon idea) announcing Dark Mode support in Office went viral: "Look closely at the Pictures icon."
		</ul>
