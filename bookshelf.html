		<h1>Bookshelf</h1>
		<p>I spend a ton of time reading. Devouring a healthy amount of well-written books in the deluge of documents, blog posts and tweets I consume is tough but I try to allocate 'book time' everyday. At least 20 minutes. I have listed some of my favourites below.
		<p>I also maintain a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5366220-akshay-bakshi">Goodreads profile</a> with exhaustive 'To Read', 'Read' and 'Want to Read' shelves.
