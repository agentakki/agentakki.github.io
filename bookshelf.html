	<h1>Bookshelf</h1>
	<p>I spend a ton of time reading. Devouring a healthy amount of well-written books in the deluge of documents, blog posts and tweets I consume is tough but I try to allocate 'book time' everyday. Atleast 20 minutes. I have listed some of my favourites below.
	<p>I also maintain a Goodreads account with exhaustive 'To Read', 'Read' and 'Want to Read' shelves. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Creativity Inc.
		<li>The Bartimaeus Trilogy
		<li>Deep Work
		<li>Thinking, Fast and Slow
		<li>The Messy Middle
		<li>The Way of Kings
	</ul>
